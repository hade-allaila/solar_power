# Solar Power App
## Overview
Solar Power App is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to monitor and control a solar power system for homes. The app provides real-time monitoring of solar power generation, battery status, home power consumption, and grid power usage. It also allows users to manage and control various electrical loads in the home.

## Features
### System Monitoring
- Battery Status : Monitor battery percentage in real-time
- Solar Power Generation : Track the amount of power being generated by solar panels
- Home Power Consumption : View the current power consumption of the home
- Grid Power Draw : Monitor power drawn from or supplied to the grid
### Load Management
- Add Loads : Add electrical devices with specific parameters:
  
  - Load name and image
  - Power consumption (watts)
  - Priority level
  - Pin assignment for connection to the controller
  - Minimum and maximum on/off times
- Control Loads : Three operation modes for each load:
  
  - Auto: System automatically manages the load based on available power
  - Forced On: Manually override to keep the load powered on
  - Forced Off: Manually override to keep the load powered off
- Load Monitoring : View real-time status and power consumption of each load
### System Configuration
- IP Configuration : Connect to the solar system controller by setting its IP address
- Language Support : Multilingual interface with support for English and Arabic
## Technical Architecture
### Frontend (Flutter)
- State Management : Provider pattern for reactive UI updates
- Networking : Dio HTTP client for API communication
- Local Storage : SQLite database for caching load information
- Internationalization : Support for English and Arabic languages
### Backend Communication
- RESTful API endpoints for:
  - Fetching system status (/home)
  - Adding loads (/addload)
  - Deleting loads (/deleteload)
  - Forcing load states (/forceload)
### Data Synchronization
- Bidirectional sync between app and controller
- Local caching for offline capability
- Periodic polling for real-time updates
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (version 3.8.1 or higher)
- Dart SDK
- Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter extensions
- A physical device or emulator running Android or iOS
### Installation
1. 1.
   Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/
yourusername/solar_app.git
```
2. 1.
   Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd solar_app
```
3. 1.
   Install dependencies:
```
flutter pub get
```
4. 1.
   Run the app:
```
flutter run
```
### Configuration
On first launch, you'll need to configure the IP address of your solar system controller in the settings screen.

## Hardware Integration
This app is designed to communicate with a custom solar power system controller. The controller should expose a REST API that matches the endpoints used by the app.
